Whether you are established in the digital space, or entering eCommerce for the first time, some basics principles apply:

•	*_Define and prioritize your objectives._*  lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.  

•	*_Get in sync about the process._* On any development project, but perhaps particularly in healthcare and fintech, the work process and documentation are important. Choose tools (Excel will do fine if you are tight for money) to manage your roadmap and requirements backlog. Discuss how handoffs will work with the development team, and what they need. How should the design files be handed off? How will user stories be tested? These organizational structure decisions will lay the road so you can drive forward without landing in potholes.

•	*_Commit to Agile._* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.  

•	*_Make the tough prioritization decisions._* Work closely with your IT architect and development team to understand the costs. Educate yourself about the costs of different technology decisions. 

•	*_Know that success is not just coding._* Particularly on complex technical projects, the technical effort and costs can occupy the majority of our thinking. Consider IT development within the context of overall business needs. How will the product be communicated, marketed and distributed? What are the training needs for users? Will workflows change? What is the impact on financial management or inventory control? These questions at the junction of code and business will ensure a successful roll-out. 

•	 *_Create a diverse team._* Successful IT projects contain diverse elements: user experience, user interface, branding, content, visual design, quality assurance.

•	*_Put the user at the center._* Like any product or service, meeting the needs of the user (customer, consumer, employee using the system) is the crucial element for success. When there is timeline pressure, it's easy to assume we understand what users need to do and what their problems are. But, it's penny-wise and pound-foolish to stay in our offices or conference rooms (or Zoom meetings) and fail to have essential conversations with real users. This can be quick and is time well spent. Weave into your development plan frequent user conversations and usability tests.
